      India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[26] is a country in South Asia.
      It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most <b>populous</b> country, and the most populous
      democracy in the world.
      Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal
      on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and
      Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east.

   <h2>About</h2>
   <p>
      By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had
      arrived on the Indian <i>subcontinent</i> from <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/africa/articles/28-photos-that-show-africas-striking-beauty-in-case-you-need-a-reason-to-visit/">Africa</a>, where they had earlier evolve.
      [27][28][29] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about
      30,000 years ago.[27] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops
      and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural
      rgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan, Pakistan.[82] These gradually
      developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[83][82] the first urban culture in
      South Asia,[84] which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India.
      [85] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying
      on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[84]

   <h3> Modern History</h3>
   <p>
      In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[122] fell again to the superior
      mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[123]
      The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule.
   </p>
   <h3>Medival History</h3>
   <p>
      The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[109]
      When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic
      Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.
